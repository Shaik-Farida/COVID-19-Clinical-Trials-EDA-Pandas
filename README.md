💊 Drugs Side Effects & Medical Condition Analysis

This repository presents a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 clinical trials, focusing on study types, enrollment sizes, locations, and completion timelines. The project leverages public clinical trial data to identify global research trends and healthcare responses to the pandemic.

## ❓ Problem Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented number of clinical trials across the globe. However, analyzing this data in a structured way is essential to understand how global health systems responded.  
This project explores clinical trial data to uncover trends in study distribution, enrollment size, and completion dates.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze the structure and metadata of COVID-19 related clinical trials  
- Visualize geographical distribution of trials  
- Identify trends in trial enrollment and study phases  
- Evaluate completion status and primary outcome dates

## 🧠 EDA in Clinical Trials:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in clinical trials helps stakeholders understand the characteristics of research datasets.  
It involves data cleaning, transformation, statistical summaries, and visualizations to detect patterns and inconsistencies.

---

## 🔍 Approach & Workflow

- Load and inspect the clinical trials dataset  
- Clean and format date and enrollment fields  
- Drop unnecessary columns and handle missing values  
- Visualize trial phases, locations, and enrollment sizes  
- Analyze study types, timelines, and sponsor distributions
